# Account Manager
Program created using Python language that allows the user keep your credentials (Username and Password) saved in a organized .TXT file!

The program has some features like "Add accounts", "Delete an account", "Update the password for an existing account", "Delete all of the saved accounts", and the most important "View added accounts".

OBS: The file "contas.txt" is necessary because the program will save your accounts there.
